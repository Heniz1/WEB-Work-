 <p>.The freecodecamp journey was a very wonderful and great experience for me alot. The journey was coding in HTML and CSS . I learnt alot from the platform which has impacted a positive impact on me.
     Now I'm able to create webpages and make it look like my favorite top websites across the globe. After working on a few projects i was able to deploy the project on the internet using Github. i was excited to see my very own project on the internet after hours of grinding hours after hours.
      On the freecodecamp I am on a considerate amount of points but not done for the time being.
